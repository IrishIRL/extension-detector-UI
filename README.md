It contains a set of files of random size and without extensions. Please investigate this set and identify jpeg images that it contains. My advice is to identify the files by adding the extention to the appropriate ones are leaving out the rest.
This process should be automated, you are free to use any programming language of your choice (even bash), by this time you should possess sufficient programming skills to achieve the goal.
Please submit the code that performs the required action.
